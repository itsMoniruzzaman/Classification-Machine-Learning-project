# Classification Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my machine learning journey! This repository showcases my practice projects in classification, where I explore and implement various algorithms to solve different classification problems. Follow along as I learn, experiment, and grow my skills in machine learning.

## Projects

1. **Rock vs Mine Prediction**: Using machine learning to classify sonar signals as rocks or mines, aiding in underwater object detection.

2. **Diabetes Prediction**: Predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on health metrics and patient data.

3. **Fake News Detection**: Developing algorithms to distinguish genuine news from fabricated ones to combat misinformation.

4. **Loan Status Prediction**: Predicting loan approval/rejection based on applicant financial history and relevant factors.

5. **Wine Quality Classification**: Classifying wines into quality categories based on chemical properties for quality control.

6. **Heart Disease Prediction**: Predicting the probability of heart disease using medical records and diagnostic tests.

7. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**: Detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card data by analyzing transactional patterns.

8. **Parkinson's Disease Detection**: Early detection of Parkinson's disease using machine learning applied to patient data.

9. **Titanic Survival Prediction**: Predicting survival likelihood for Titanic passengers based on demographic and ticket information.

10. **Spam Mail Detection**: Automatic identification and filtering of spam emails from legitimate ones to enhance email security.

11. **Breast Cancer Detection**: Early detection of breast cancer using medical imaging and patient data.
